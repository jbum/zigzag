# CLAUDE.MD

The local python is using a venv, and there are .autoenv scripts to activate it.

I typically use pypy3, rather than python3 for working scripts, for a performance boost.

We're gonna create a set of python scripts for generating, solving and publishing Slants or Gokigen Naname puzzles.  More info in PROJECT.md

## Development Notes

- The project uses `pypy3` for better performance
- A virtual environment is used (activated via `.autoenv` scripts)
- See `PROJECT.md` for the original development plan
- See `RULES.md` for details on the solving rules and their tiers
- See `PROGRESS.md` for development history that was maintained during the initial development process.
